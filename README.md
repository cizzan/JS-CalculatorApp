# Simple Calculator App

A **Simple Calculator App** built with **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. This project is a basic implementation of a calculator that can perform simple arithmetic operations, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

## Features

- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive design.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Button**: Reset the calculator input and result.
- **Responsive Design**: Works on different screen sizes.
- **Support for Keyboard Input**: You can also use the calculator from the keyboard.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: For structuring the app.
- **CSS**: For styling the app.
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the calculator functionality.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the ZIP file.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.
3. Use the calculator by clicking the buttons or using keyboard for numbers and operations.

## Files Structure

```
Simple-Calculator-App/
â”‚
â”œâ”€â”€ index.html        # Main HTML file
â”œâ”€â”€ app.css           # CSS file for styling
â”œâ”€â”€ app.js            # JavaScript file for functionality
â””â”€â”€ README.md         # Project documentation
```

## Implementation Details

### HTML
The `index.html` file contains the structure of the calculator, including buttons for numbers and operators.

### CSS
The `app.css` file defines the styles, such as layout, colors, and spacing, to make the calculator visually appealing.

### JavaScript
The `app.js` file contains the logic for performing arithmetic operations, clearing the input, and displaying the result. It also also helps to switch from light and dark theme.

## Example Usage

1. Enter a number by clicking the numeric buttons in the interface.
2. Select an operator (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`).
3. Enter another number.
4. Click the `=` button to see the result.
5. Use the `C` button to clear the input and start again.
6. The calculator also works perfectly using the keyboard keys.
7. For Keyboard, use numbers for entering numbres, (+, -, *, / and %) for operators and "=" button to see the result.
8. Press Esc button to clear the input.
9. To delete you can either use âŒ«Backspace or delete keys.
